# The Payment Architecture Manifesto (v0.9)

A white paper on payment architecture.

This document outlines foundational principles and advanced patterns for building trustworthy, resilient, and fraud-resistant payment infrastructure. It covers real-world techniques for modeling payment flows, escrow logic, reconciliation, conditional value handling, geographic abstraction, and operational observability.

Whether you're designing B2B disbursement systems, compliance-critical platforms, or multi-rail global payments, this manifesto is intended to serve as a reference architecture for practitioners building from first principles.

## Topics Covered

- Payment flow state modeling and typed obligations  
- Escrow as a programmable trust layer  
- Anti-fraud and compliance architecture  
- Cross-border and multi-currency abstractions  
- Reconciliation, finality, and ledger correctness  
- Resilience under degraded systems and partial failures  
- Lessons learned and anti-patterns from production
